This Streamlit application is designed for malaria detection using a pre-trained TensorFlow model. It allows users to explore data, make predictions, and learn more about the project.

## Usage

1. **Select Activity**: Choose an activity from the sidebar menu:
    - **About Data**: Provides information about the dataset used for training the model.
    - **Prediction**: Enables users to upload an image and predict whether it's infected or uninfected with malaria.
    - **About me**: Learn more about the creator of this application.

2. **Prediction**:
    - Upload an image by clicking on the file uploader.
    - Click the "Predict" button to obtain the model's prediction.
    - The application will display whether the image is infected or uninfected with malaria along with the probability score.

## About Data
